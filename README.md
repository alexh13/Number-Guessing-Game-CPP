# Number-Guessing-Game-CPP
A program that plays a number guessing game with a Human user. The Human user will think of a number between 1 and 100, inclusive. The program will make guesses and the user will tell the program to guess higher or lower.

What I learned:
- Implement syntactically correct C++ functions including function prototypes, function definitions, and function invocations.
- Critically analyze the functional decomposition of a program and determine the best decomposition to meet the objectives of effective programming practice.
- Identify and implement correct parameter passing techniques.
